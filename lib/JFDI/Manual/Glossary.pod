=item action

An action is a specifically designed RPC call that can do something to the system.

Generally, an action takes L</argument>, which are represented as L</form field>s via the web UI


=item active

=item AJAX

=item constructor

=item mandatory

=item moniker

Every instance of an action (and other types of JFDI objects, too) has 
a B<moniker>.  A moniker is an arbitrary-length nonempty string containing
no semicolons.  Monikers need not be globally unique, but they must be unique
within a single request.  Monikers have no semantic meaning.
