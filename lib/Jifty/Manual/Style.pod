Jifty::Manual::Style - Jifty coding style guide

=head3 Private documentation

When documenting a private method, or providing documentation which is
not useful to the user of the module (and is presumably useful to the
developer), wrap it in =begin/end private.  This way it does not show
up in perldoc where a user would see it and yet is still available and
well formatted (that is, not just a lump comment) when looking at the
code.

  =begin private

  =head2 import_extra

  Called by L<Test::More>'s C<import> code when L<Jifty::Test> is first
  C<use>'d, it calls L</setup>, and asks Test::More to export its
  symbols to the namespace that C<use>'d this one.

  =end private

  sub import_extra {
        ...
  }


=head3 Test temp files

Files created by tests should be declared as such using
Jifty::Test->test_file() so they are cleaned up on a successful test
run.


=head3 Use Shell::Command

Shell::Command has a number of functions which work like common shell file
commands such as touch, cp and mv.  Use them instead of coding your own.

For example, instead of this:

    open my $file, ">foo";
    close $file;

Do this:

    use Shell::Command;
    touch $file;

=cut
